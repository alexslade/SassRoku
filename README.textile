h1. SassRoku

This is a simple sinatra template for hosting static sites on heroku. 

Use SASS + HAML, and serve everything from heroku's cache for free!
  
  
h6. Alpha

This first version is rough and will be updated as I use it more. Patches are extremely welcome, feel free to contact me.
  
  
h3. Features
* Catch-all html routes, just put your Haml files inside 'views/pages/'
* Put your SASS files inside 'views/stylesheets/'
* A layout file
* Anyhting put in 'public' is served as a static file
* Cache-control headers for 24 hours caching
* Simple template built on Sinatra, really easy to modify and hack on. 

h3. Installation

Clone this repository and make your own changes.

bc. bundle install
rackup

I recommended installing the 'shotgun' gem and runnning that instead of rackup.
